<h2># Scientific-Calculator-with-GUI-Java</h2>
<p><b>Building on the example discussed during the lectures, you need to write a java program for a GUI-based scientific calculator 
(not using Window Builder) that performs the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) as well as the scientific calculations.</p></b>

<h3>This task is an individual project:</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Essential Feature: the scientific calculator needs to include buttons for:
  +, -, *, /, (, ), sin, cos, tan, square root, cube root, log, x2, xy, n! (factorial), % and π.</li><br/>
<li> Essential Feature: The scientific calculator will also have 11 buttons for the numbers (0 – 9 and “=”).</li><br/>
<li>Essential Feature: Also, you’ll need to have a text field to display the result of the calculation.</li><br/>
<li>Essential Feature: the calculator needs to have memory functions (four buttons) to save 4 different values 
that can be recalled even after closing the program.</li></ul></p>
